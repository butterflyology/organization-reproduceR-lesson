# File Organization

## Learning Objectives

*  Evaluate folder and file structure of a project.
*  Recognize common problems that occur in file organization.
*  Distinguish between input and output files.
*  Integrate file naming standards into projects.

## Activity 01 - Setting up a new project

Using what we have learned so far, we are going to set up a new project in a way that facilitates reproducibility.

Resources:

  * slides
  * good example 1 of a reproducible project in the wild
  * good example 2 of a reproducible project in the wild

**Exercise**: Imagine you have just been funded for an exciting new project. Working with a partner, create a folder, directory structure and file naming conventions for the project.  

Think about these questions as you create your project:

  * What type of study is this?
  * What kind of data are you going to collect?
  * What are the file formats of the raw data?
  * Will the raw data need transformation / modification before analyses?
  * What types of analyses will you do with the data?
  * How will you store and communicate exploratory analyses and results?
  * What software / scripts will you use to do the analyses?
  * How will you make your figures for an eventual paper?
  * Who are your collaborators?
