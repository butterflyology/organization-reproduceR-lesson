## How to contribute

* All contributions should be through [pull request]. You will
  probably use the "Fork & pull" model.

* Keep a pull request topically related. i.e., only bundle strictly
  related changes into a pull request.
  
* We are trying to follow the [lesson template]. Any changes should
  make us more conforming, not less.
