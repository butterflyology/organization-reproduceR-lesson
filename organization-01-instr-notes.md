## Activity 01 - Setting up a new project

**Time required**: 30 minutes

Now that they have seen the best practices slides, the students will apply these
lessons to set up a new project. This activity should reinforce the idea that it
is much easier to set things up right from the start, rather than cleaning up
messes at a future date. It is meant to get the learners thinking about
file names, file organization, and file content and what these can tell us about
a project.   

Point the students to the slides for reference, as well as the two example projects, in the *Resources* section. Have them work in pairs to set up a new project in a way that facilitates reproducibility. Let the students come up with the project themselves, rather than providing sample ecology / genomics / social science / etc projects.

Potential examples for the resources section (feel free to highlight ones relevant for your workshop):

  * Jackman et al. "UniqTag: Content-Derived Unique and Stable Identifiers for Gene Annotation":  [publication](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128026) and [repo](https://github.com/sjackman/uniqtag-paper)
  * Finnegan et al. "Paleontological baselines for evaluating extinction risk in the modern
  * FitzJohn et al. "How much of the world is woody?" [publication](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.12260/abstract) and [repo](https://github.com/richfitz/wood)

oceans": [publication](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2015/04/29/348.6234.567.DC1/Finnegan.SM.pdf) and [repo](https://github.com/seananderson/paleobaselines/)

Put the Exercise and Questions on the screen.

Give them about 20 minutes.

**Discussion**:
  * how did your structure differ from the resources?
  * why did you make changes?
  * what did you and your partner agree / disagree on?
  * were there aspects of the best practices that were difficult to apply to your project?
  * can you imagine this structure evolving over the life of the project? how would you make this structure extensible?
